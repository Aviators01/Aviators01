- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Queva
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development.

Just graduated from Grande Prairie Regional College with a computer science diploma. I have roughly a year of experience in Java, python, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript, WebGL.
My first/last project was for school and involved stuff with a raspberry pi. I was trying to develop it as a home automation type project. It still has bugs to fix, but
I did get it partially working. Hopefully, I can develop more stuff for it in the future. Currently, I working on web development stuff in order to learn and to round out
my computer programming knowledge though I realize I still have much to learn!
