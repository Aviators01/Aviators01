Hi,

Iâ€™m Timothy Queva. At the moment, I'm currently exploring web development. I just graduated from Grande Prairie Regional College with a computer science diploma. I have roughly a year of experience in Java, python, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript, WebGL. My most recent project was for school. I was trying to use the raspberry pi as a server for home automation since it would seem to me that the future of IoT is home servers. It still has bugs to fix, but I did get it partially working. Hopefully, I can develop more stuff for it in the future.

Currently, I am working on web development stuff in order to round out my computer programming knowledge. I realize though that I still have much to learn! In the future, I will add to my projects app development and artificial intelligence.
